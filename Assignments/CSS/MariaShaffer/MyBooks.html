<font color="white"><h3>With a prophecy lost in darkness war has split the world in two. Chaos and Shadow roam the west, while in the east peace reigns forgetful of what lies between them. When a break in tactics occur, a young Seon must flee from his home. Forced to find a new one, he must learn how his birthright will influence the future. But when the shadow shift focus, he is left confused. The pendulum of time, will cause a new prophecy to come to light. And with it the past may prove best forgotten as a new era takes reign.</h3></font>
